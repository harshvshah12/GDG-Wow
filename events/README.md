# GDG Events

This directory contains materials for various GDG events. Each event should have its own subdirectory.

## Directory Structure

Each event directory should follow this structure:
```
events/
  ├── YYYY-MM-DD-event-name/
  │   ├── README.md          # Event details and summary
  │   ├── slides/            # Presentation slides
  │   ├── code/              # Code samples and demos
  │   └── resources/         # Additional resources
  └── ...
```
